# Immigrant Doctor-Hospital Matching Platform

This project is a platform that matches immigrant doctors in Canada with hospitals that need their skills. It translates the credentials of the doctors to their Canadian equivalents in order to match the credentials to the requirements of the hospitals. Hospitals specify their needs in the form of job postings, and doctors apply to those jobs via the platform.

## Branching Strategy

To keep our project organized and make collaboration easy, please follow this simple branching strategy:

- Always create a new branch for any feature, bug fix, or change you are working on. Give your branch a clear name (for example, `feature/doctor-profile` or `fix/login-bug`).
- Do not work directly on the `main` branch.
- When your work is ready, push your branch to GitHub and create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes into the `main` branch.
- In your PR, make sure to add the specified reviewer so they can review your code before it is merged.

If youâ€™re not sure who the reviewer should be, ask in the project chat or check the repository settings. This process helps us keep the codebase stable and makes it easier for everyone to contribute!
